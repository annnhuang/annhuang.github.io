Hi 👋🏼 I'm Ann. I'm a PhD student in the Research Training Group ["Computational Cognition"](https://www.comco.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/startpage.html)
at the [Institute of Cognitive Science](https://www.ikw.uni-osnabrueck.de/en/home.html) at the University Osnabrück.

I am part of the Neurobiopsychology lab, where I am advised by [Dr. Prof. Peter König](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ieubd0EAAAAJ).

My research interests lie at the intersection of cognition and human-computer interaction. I love to think about how behavioral principles can be applied to improve our interaction with technologies.
